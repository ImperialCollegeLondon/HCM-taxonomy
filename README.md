## HCM Cohort Data Collection

Patients included in our analysis were consecutively enrolled into a prospective registry at the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Royal Brompton Hospital Cardiovascular Biobank project between 2009-2015, after referral to the ICC service or CMR unit. In total, 436 subjects with HCM were included in this study (see study flowchart in main paper). HCM diagnosis was independently adjudicated by a cardiomyopathy specialist based on established clinical and CMR criteria where all patients met the American Heart Association criteria for diagnosis. This was defined as a wall
thickness of 15mm or greater, or 13–14mm if there was a first degree relative with HCM, not explained by another cardiac or systemic disease-causing abnormal loading conditions, or had disproportionate apical wall thickness and tapering in keeping with an apical HCM phenotype. Clinical co-variates, medication status and anthropometric data was collected at the date of study enrollment. All subjects under went diagnostic assessment: 1) advanced imaging (CMR and stress echocardiography were LVOTO was suspected) and 2) genetic analysis of rare and common variants associated with cardiomyopathy. CMRs selected for analysis were those closest to the date of enrolment or the first diagnostic study available. 2D CMR measurements were extracted from clinical reports undertaken by experienced clinicians at the CMR unit at Royal Brompton Hospital.  Clinical outcome (mortality) data was collected from review of NHS Shared Care Records (median follow-up time of 10.2 years).
